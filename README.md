# A mime database for FACT
This repository contains mime definitions for filetypes commonly found in firmwares.

## Installation
Run `make` to create a compiled mime database `fact.mgc`.

For example you can put this in the directory shown by `file -v` to make use of
it when using the standart unix `file` tool.
